PFSMS is a tool for sending multiple SMS messages using a Mobile Phone connected via USB to the computer.
Since I myself use a Samsung Galaxy Phone, it is specifically configured for this phohne, but it will probably
work with other Phones supporting 3GPP AT-command set specifictions.

Program was developed using Go and for Windows. It should be possible to adjust it for Linux and Mac fairly easily.

For more information, please contact, with a smile
